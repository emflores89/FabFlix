
SAX Parser was used for parsing XML documents

Optimizations used for XML_Parsing:
	1.Caching Data - Data from XML was stored in HashMap<String,Object> where objects were either Cast.java Movie.java 
	2.Turning off Auto-Commit - In SAX Parser.java before inserting data into the Database. I turned off Auto-Commit until
								database processing was complete.
	3.Using prepared Statements - Used for inserting multiple entries containing the same parameters. See SQL.java
	
Running the SAX parser took around 1 minute. On my computer and on AWS

This was ran on a laptop with a Solid State Hard Drive.
