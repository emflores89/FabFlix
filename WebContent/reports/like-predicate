I use the LIKE predicate in my main fabflix page. I use two LIKE predicates. 
for the search bar I use %term% for movie.titles. For example if the user
inputs term into the search bar one of the possible query results would be
movie.title like terminator. The second LIKE predicate I use is with the letter
browsing 'letter%'. Which finds movie.title whose title starts with that letter or is the 
first letter in their title. For example, user clicks on A then a possible movie result would be "A Orange Clock". 
Since its movie title starts with A. The code were I implemented these predicates is found in SearchServlet.java.
Where I created query based on what predicate was chosen:

if(type.equals("letter"))
		{
			PARAM = " movies.title LIKE '" + term + "%'";
				
		}
